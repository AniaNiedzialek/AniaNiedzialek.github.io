          Iâ€™m a Computer Science student passionate about technology, education, and creating solutions that help others.
          I am currently based in the Bay Area and I am a junior at San Jose State University. 

          To give a little introduction about myself - I have moved to the US 2 years ago to pursue a degree in Computer Science. 
          I have graduated from De Anza College with 4.00 GPA and with associate degrees in:
          - Mathematics
          - Physics
          - Computer Science
          I have transferred to San Jose State University, located in the heart of Silicon Valley in order to further pursue 
          my knowledge learning from the best in the industry!
