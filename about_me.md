Hello, my name is Ania and I am Computer Science Junior at **San Jose State University**, in San Jose, California. 
I'm a creative problem-solver passionate about technology, design, and innovation.

Right now, I'm working on:
- Building interactive personal websites with **Jekyll**
- Exploring **AI-powered dance motion tracking**
- Writing test automation scripts in **Python and Java**

I'm especially interested in:
- Human-computer interaction  
- Visual computing and real-time feedback systems  
- Designing engaging user interfaces and immersive web experiences  
- Bioeningeering and technology

When I'm not coding, you might find me:
- Competing in International West Coast Swing Dance Competition
- Designing websites and writing digital content  
- Exploring new ideas in tech and education, with a concentration on developing practical solutions to real-world challenges
